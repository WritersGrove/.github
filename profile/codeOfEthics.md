# Code of Ethics

## 1. User-Centric Commitment

We believe that you, the user, are our customer—not the product. This principle guides all of our decisions and ensures that your rights and privacy are always prioritized.

## 2. Transparency and Control

- **Data Ownership**: You own your content. We only request the right to display it on our site. You have full ownership and control over your data.
- **The Right To Delete**: Unlike some sites we won't name, here you have the ability to delete your data at any time. Deleted data will be permanently removed from our servers after a 30-day grace period.
- **Simple Delete**: No need to contact support. With a single button click and confirmation you can delete a series, story, chapter, or your whole account. We won't beg you to stay.
- **Privacy Protection**: We will not sell your information to third parties. We use privacy-focused tools like Plausible.io for analytics and only collect the minimum information necessary to operate our services.

## 3. Ethical Use of Technology

- **We Do Not Intend To Train AI**: We have no plans to allow any of your data to be used to train AI. We understand that the world changes, and should that ever change...
- **No AI Training Without Consent**: We will not use your data to train AI without your explicit consent. If we ever decide to involve user data in AI training, it will be strictly opt-in, and participating users will be compensated.

## 4. Freedom of Expression with Responsibility

- **Content Moderation**: We respect your right to share your stories and content freely. We only intervene in specific circumstances, such as legal obligations or threats to our business model. Our moderation is minimal but necessary to maintain a safe and legal environment. We will only remove content under specific circumstances.
- **DMCA Takedown Notice**: If we receive a DMCA takedown notice that you do not challenge.
- **Court Order**: We receive a court order from a court that has jurisdiction over us.
- **Business Requirement**: This is a business, and we need to make money. Credit card processors and advertisers can limit the content we are allowed to show, even if that content is legal. We will do our best to prevent this from being an issue, but it is what it is.

## 5. Community Respect and Engagement

- **Not the same as stories**: While we will not moderate or restrict speech in the stories posted, we will moderate our community engagement.
- **No Drama Policy**: We value a positive and respectful community. We will intervene in conflicts that disrupt the harmony of our community, with a clear process for warnings and bans if necessary. Hate speech, harassment, and discrimination will not be tolerated.

## 6. Commitment to Privacy

- **No Selling of User Information**: We respect your privacy and will never sell your information to third parties. Ads may be displayed on the content of unpaid users to support our platform financially. We will do our best to ensure your privacy is maintained. However, once again here we are limited to what we can do due to the requirements of the ad networks.

## 7. Legal Compliance and Jurisdiction

- **Adherence to Applicable Laws**: We comply with applicable US laws, particularly those of Michigan. Our services are not designed for use in the EU or UK, and we do not recognize their jurisdiction. If you use our platform from these regions, you acknowledge that it is not designed to comply with local regulations.
- **The Rest of the World**: If your country has some insane law that they expect people in other countries to observe, that is a you problem, and you shouldn't use our site.

## 8. Ethical Business Practices

- **Fair Revenue Model**: We aim to run a sustainable business that supports our small team without resorting to unethical practices. Our revenue comes from ads and paid services, not from exploiting user data.

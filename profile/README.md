## Philosophy

At Writers Grove, we believe governance should be open, not hidden in fine print.  
All of our policies — from our ethics commitments to our terms of service — are  
kept here in plain view so you can see exactly how we run the platform.  
Transparency isn’t a marketing slogan; it’s how we operate.

You are the customer, not the product. What this means…

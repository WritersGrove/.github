# Terms of Service

_Last updated: September 16, 2025_

Welcome to Writers Grove. By accessing or using our services (“Services”), you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). Please read them carefully.

---

## 0. Our Legal Position

Writers Grove is a **U.S.-based company located in Michigan**, with servers located in Ohio.  
We do **not** market to, advertise to, or actively solicit customers in the **UK, EU, or Canada**. We do not recognize those jurisdictions as having authority over us.

That said, we recognize frameworks such as **GDPR (EU/UK)**, **UK Data Protection Act**, and **Canada’s PIPEDA** as **best practices**. While not legally obligated to follow them, we voluntarily align our practices with their principles where reasonable, in the interest of transparency and consumer trust.

All disputes will be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan, United States.

## 1. Accounts

- You must provide accurate information when creating an account.
- You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password.
- You must be at least **13 years old** to use our Services.
- We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.

---

## 2. Content and Ownership

- **Your Content**: You retain full ownership of all works you publish on Writers Grove.
- **License to Us**: By publishing on Writers Grove, you grant us a **limited, non-exclusive license** to host, display, and distribute your works on our platform.
- **Export Rights**: You may export your works (e.g., EPUB, PDF, Markdown) at any time for backup or use elsewhere.
- **Removal**: You may delete your works or your account at any time. Deleted data will be permanently removed from our servers after a 30-day grace period.

---

## 3. Payments and Subscriptions

- **Subscription Fee**: Authors may subscribe for $14.95/month.
- **Free Tier**: Free users are supported by advertising revenue. Ads may be shown on free-tier pages.
- **Paid Tier**: Paid authors keep 100% of their monetization (ads, tips, Stripe, PayPal).
- **Refunds**: We do not provide prorated refunds. You may cancel anytime and retain access until the end of your billing period.

### Chargebacks, Refunds, and Account Suspension

We take chargebacks very seriously because they impose costs and legal risks on the platform.

- **Immediate Suspension:** If a chargeback is initiated, the associated account will be **immediately suspended and locked**. While suspended, the account will have only two options:

  1. **Download Content & Delete Account**
  2. **Contact Support to Resolve the Dispute**

- **14-Day Resolution Window:** The account holder has **14 days** from the suspension date to contact us at **support@writersgrove.net** to resolve the issue.

- **After 14 Days:**

  - If no contact is made, the account will be **permanently deleted**.
  - Content will be **backed up to a private S3 bucket** for a period of **90 days**, during which time it may be made available for download upon request. After 90 days, the backup will be permanently deleted.

- **Refunds:** If you believe a payment was made in error, contact us directly. Refunds may be granted at our discretion. Do not initiate a chargeback—doing so triggers the suspension process above.

- **Ban:** Accounts deleted due to unresolved chargebacks will be **permanently banned** and ineligible for new accounts or referral earnings.

## 4. Referral Program

- **Commission**: Earn 10% of subscription fees (after payment processor fees) for each paying author you refer.
- **Lifetime Rule**: Commissions remain valid for the lifetime of the referred account, even if they cancel and later resubscribe.
- **Attribution**: First referrer is locked in. Referrals cannot be stolen or reassigned.
- **Pending Period**: Commissions are pending for 90 days to protect against chargebacks/refunds.
- **Payout Cycle**: Matured commissions are paid monthly via PayPal MassPay.
- **Minimum Payout**: $25.
- **Fraud Prevention**: Self-referrals, duplicate accounts, or fraud result in forfeited commissions and possible account suspension.

## 5. Content Guidelines and Moderation

### General Policy

- Writers Grove is designed as a platform for free expression. We do **not** actively moderate content beyond what is legally required.
- Content moderation occurs in three ways:
  1. **Legal Compliance**: DMCA notices, valid court orders, or law enforcement requests.
  2. **Community Complaints**: Users may flag content. Complaints are aggregated and acted upon at thresholds.
  3. **Automatic Rules**: Certain complaint categories trigger automatic action.

### Complaint Thresholds

- **10% Complaint Rate**: A warning is sent to the author.
- **25% Complaint Rate**: Content is shadow banned (still visible to the author, hidden from others).

### Automatic Actions

- **NSFW Mislabeling**: Content not marked as NSFW but flagged as NSFW will be shadow banned.
- **Child Harm Content**: Any content depicting the exploitation or harm of children will be **immediately deleted** and reported to authorities.
- **Other Illegal Content**: Removed if required by law (terrorism, hate speech incitement, etc.).

### DMCA Compliance

We comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

- **Takedown Notices**: Send to **dmca@writersgrove.net** or our mailing address.
- **Counter-Notices**: Authors may submit a counter-notice if they believe the takedown is in error. If not challenged, the content remains removed.
